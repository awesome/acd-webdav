# Purpose #

This package provides a WebDAV interface for Amazon Cloud Drive.

# Usage #

TODO - jsDAV style interface

# Why #

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) can be easily installed by most users on most computers. This allows us to focus on the goal without getting lost in the weeds of making something cross-system compatible.

[WebDAV](http://www.webdav.org/) is natively supported on most operating systems. [FUSE](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/) is only natively supported in Linux. This should be mountable as a local file-path **without requiring file synchronization**.
